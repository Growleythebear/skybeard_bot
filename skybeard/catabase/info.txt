yaml and pickle files are stored here. Current files used by the bot are:

catabase.yaml           - registered Dota 2 players
catmins.p               - catabase admins
d2_patch_id.yaml        - gid for latest Dota 2 patch
echochat.yaml           - chat_id for chat to send /echo messages to 
feeds.p                 - Dota 2 'feeding stats' for registered players
gyms.yaml               - GPS coordinates for gyms users attend
unpatched.yaml          - copy of potentially unpatched players from catabase.yaml

-All files should be automatically created other than catamins and gyms.
-Catamins are added through the python interface and is just a python list of telegram id's for the admins (will switch to yaml)
-Gyms is a list of dictionaries of structure:
    {
        lat: <latitude coords>, 
        lon: <longitude coords>, 
        name: <gym name string>
    }
